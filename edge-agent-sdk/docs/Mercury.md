Mercury is a powerful and flexible library for working with decentralized identifiers and secure communications
protocols. Whether you are a developer looking to build a secure and private messaging app or a more complex
decentralized system requiring trusted peer-to-peer connections, Mercury provides the tools and features you need to
establish, manage, and secure your communications easily.

## A Secure Communications Protocol SDK for DIDs

Mercury is a comprehensive library that provides a set of secure, standards-based communications protocols for
establishing and managing trusted, peer-to-peer connections and interactions between decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
Mercury is designed to be transport-agnostic and interoperable. It can be used across a wide range of communication
channels and platforms.

DIDCommV2 is a secure, privacy-preserving messaging protocol that securely and efficiently exchanges information between
DIDs. Mercury supports a range of DIDCommV2 operations, including pack encrypted and unpack, which enables users to
securely transmit and receive messages across the network.

With Mercury, developers can easily establish and manage trusted, peer-to-peer connections between DIDs, allowing for
secure and private communication across various platforms and use cases. Mercury provides the tools and features you
need to get the job done, whether you are building a messaging app, a decentralized social network, or any other
application that requires secure and private communications.

Mercury also provides a range of advanced features, including support for message threading, priority levels, and
message expiration and support for a range of transport protocols, including HTTP.
